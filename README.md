# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Overview
Citi Bikes are hot and popular in NYC, but they can be the next big thing in Des Moines with investor help! The research completed on the August 2019 NYC Citi Bike usage proves that there is a demand for folks to use bikes as a cost efficient alternative to cars - for commuting to work and leisure activities. 

## Results
The visualizations in the tableau story board reveal the following key points:
- Trip duration renting Citi Bikes usually lasts no more than 60 minutes, and the vast majority of trips are no longer than 20 minutes
- The vast majority of Citi Bike users are male
- Peak hours of usage on weekdays is during work commuting hours (8-9:00AM and 5-7:00PM)
- Peak hours of usage on weekends starts in the late morening and countues until dinner time (11:00AM - 5:00PM) 
- The majority of Citi Bike users are suscribers
- Most of the top bike stations for both starting and ending a journeys are located on the upper east and west sides, mid town, and downtown areas.

## Summary
The analysis on NYC Citi Bike usages proves that when provided the option for using the bicycle as a travelling vessle, many people grasp the opportunity. Even though the visualizations have proved there is a need for bcycles, there are some concerns:

- Des Moines is a smaller city where travelling destinations are more spread out than NYC. Will people be interested in potentially travelling further distances?
- Will this be a seasonal business? The data was taken from the month of August. What is Citi Bike usage like during the winter months?
- Why are there more male than female suscribers?
- A very large percentage of the population in NYC dont't own cars because of the lack of parking availability and city traffic congestion. The result is that the majority of New Yorkers favor public transportation. Given that Des Moines residents mostly use cars to commute and not public transit, will there be the need for a Citi Bike business?

For the next steps of research, I recommend two more visualizations with the NYC Citi Bike data set
- 'User category by age' - Similar to the user by gender visualization, this graph can show more information about who are Citi Bike's suscribers.
- 'Most popular start station' and 'Most popular end stations' - Specific start and ending locations can help determine which neighborhoods are most popular for bike usage. Is it primarily a residential neighborhood, working neighborhood (like the financial district, etc...).
